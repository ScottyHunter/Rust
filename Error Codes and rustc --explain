// If you run into an error, you can use rustc --explain and the error code for a brief explanation
// Example

rustc --explain E0384

An immutable variable was reassigned.

Erroneous code example:

fnmain() {
    let x = 3;
    x = 5; // error, reassignment of immutable variable
}

By default, variables in Rust are immutable. To fix this error, add
the keyword mut after the keyword let when declaring the variable. For
example:

fn main() {
    let mut x = 3;
    x = 5;
}
(END)
