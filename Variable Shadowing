Variable shadowing means redeclaring a variable. The original variable is "replaced" by the new one.

fn main() {
    let grams_of_protein = "100.345"; // string, because double quotes
    let grams_of_protein = 100.345; // float, because decimal
    let mut grams_of_protein = 100; // integer, no decimal, no double quotes
    grams_of_protein = 105; // can only be replaced by integer type.
}

Still looking to see if there is a way to print the type of variable to the screen before the variable is reused.
Example:

fn main() {
    let grams_of_protein = "100.345"; //string, because double quotes
    println!(this variable is a string);

    let grams_of_protein = 100.345; //float, because decimal
    println!(this variable is a float);

    let mut grams_of_protein = 100; //integer, no decimal, no double quotes
    println!(this variable is an integer);

    grams_of_protein = 105;
}
