fn main() {
    let gym_reps = 10; //immutable
    println!("I plan to do {gym_reps} reps");
}

I know this has two mains; just putting both in here to show the difference. 

fn main() {
    let mut gym_reps = 10; // mutable
    println!("I plan to do {gym_reps} reps");

    gym_reps = 15;
    println!("I now plan to do {gym_reps} reps");
}
