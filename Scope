A scope is the boundary or region of code where a name is valid.

A block is the area between an opening curly brace and a closing curly brace.

fn main() {
    let coffee_price = 5.99;
    
    {
        let cookie_price = 1.99;
        println!("The price is {cookie_price}");
    }

    println!("The coffee price is {coffee_price}");
    println!("The cookie price is {cookie_price}");

}

You will get an error if you try to run the above because the scope of cookie_price is not in the same scope as coffee_price.
You could even do something like this:
fn main() {
    let coffee_price = 5.99;
    
    {
        let coffee_price = 1.99;
        println!("The price is {coffee_price}");
    }

    println!("The coffee price is {coffee_price}");

}

And you'd get two separate prices for coffee_price printed to the screen.
